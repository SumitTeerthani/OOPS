**Hybrid Inheritance**

seems like we are combining classes
student class 
boy class has student class
girl class has student class properties
There is a class called Male 
There is a class called Female
Boy class inherit the properties of Male class
Girl class inherit the properties of female class

SO basically multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance mix kr diya
