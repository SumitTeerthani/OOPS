how to initialise Child class ?
This is the way to do it 

class {child name} : {access modifier} {parent class}
class student: public Human

if Human has private protected and public elements then th student mein private elements aa nhi sakta ar protected hamesha as a protected/private hi jayega  public ko ap as a public or protected or protected rakh skte ho child class mein .
